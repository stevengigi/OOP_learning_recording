####  OOP 9/23

- learn how to use class(with public and private)
    - understand class private
        - private usually put some data (can't read or change directly by other file or assignment)
        - public usually put some function with constructor , getting data, etc(it will show in the future)
        - the class data with pointer need to contruct a new address(can't share with input data address)!!!
    - ASSERT_NEAR(compare,output,abs_error)
        - abs_error : it will be true if |compare - output | < abs_error
